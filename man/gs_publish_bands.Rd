\title{Publish Each Band of a Raster Separately to GeoServer}
\usage{
gs_publish_bands(geoserver_url, user, password, workspace, data_store, raster)
}
\arguments{
\item{geoserver_url}{A character string specifying the base URL of the GeoServer
instance (e.g., "http://localhost:8080/geoserver").}

\item{user}{A character string for the GeoServer username with publish permissions.}

\item{password}{A character string for the GeoServer password corresponding to
the specified user.}

\item{workspace}{A character string specifying the target workspace where the
raster bands will be published.}

\item{data_store}{A character string specifying the base name of the data store
in GeoServer. Band names will be appended to this base name.}

\item{raster}{A character string specifying the file path to the GeoTIFF raster
file to be uploaded.}
}
\value{
A named list where the names correspond to the raster bands and the values
  are integers indicating the status of the operation for each band:
  - `0`: The band was published successfully.
  - `1`: An error occurred during the publishing process.
}
\description{
Publishes each band of a multi-band GeoTIFF raster file as a separate coverage
in a specified workspace and data store on a GeoServer instance.
