The workflow for geographic data typically involves:  

- **Data acquisition**: Many datasets are sourced from web downloads.  
- **Data transformation**: This includes tasks such as raster composition, resolution adjustments, clipping, and style management.  
- **Data storage**: Storing the processed data in databases, such as PostGIS.  
- **Data publication**: Making the data accessible via platforms like GeoServer.  

The goal of the `sigugr` package is to provide a comprehensive set of functions that simplify the processes of transforming, storing, and publishing geographic data.

## Installation

You can install the development version of sigugr from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:
